This is an app I am working on that allows managers (scheduling supervisors) to <strong>post scheduling needs</strong> and open shifts where employees can sign up for.

After they sign up, I plan to create a feature where, after the employee signs up and the scheduling supervisor APPROVES that shift for that particular employee, that employee must then PRESS A BUTTON (or perform some action) to acknowledge that the approval because, let's say the manager approves the shift, but that employee claims he/she/they never saw the approval and thought that the manager gave the shift to someone else? Then what?

Also, I want to create another feature where, a few days before the scheduled shift, that employee will receive a REMINDER (via email) of their upcoming shift so that they won't "accidentally" make conflicting plans. I may/may not make the employee acknowledge those follow-up emails.
