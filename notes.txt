WORK ON "onHandleAwardShift" inside Applied.jsx!!!
The shiftsPendingEmployeeConfirm inside database.json still does NOT show the shiftID!!!
NOTE: json-server database converts EVERY data you put in (even strings) as OBJECTS. If you enter a string, it will try to parse the string as an object, which it cannot because it's a string. In that case, it will just store {id: 1}.
