NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR JSON-SERVER!!!

different candidates CANNOT apply for the same shift b/c the "id" for the shift would be the same. "id" is a json-server id. Normally, it is 1, 2, 3, etc.... You are REASSIGNING IT!!!

Work on onApproveRequest function inside ShiftCandidatesPage.

FOR .env.local VARIABLES IN VITE!!!

VITE_EMAILJS_API_KEY. Replace REACT_APP_API_KEY with VITE_EMAILJS_API_KEY
